# Y-NOTE?
This is not really a blog. This is for making notes, single user, with no login authentication.

## TODO
- Multiuser with password, not necessarily using login, just requiring password each new post or edit.
- ~~Edit and delete (with modification timestamp), of course~~ (Done)
- Commenting capability (after implementing multiuser)
- ~~Topic tags~~ (Done)
- Possibly editing history (with diff style like Quora)
- ~~Search capability~~ (Not perfect, but enough)
